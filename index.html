<H2>About Me</H2>
<p>I am 20 years old living in Portland Oregon since 2012. I used to live in Canada on a small Island called Salt Spring. I went to High middle school plus high school in Portland and University in Canada until covid changed my plans.
I really enjoy playing soccer, fly fishing and skiing! I have done yard services in the past years but most recently during covid I worked a little with Doordash which has been fun. I took multiple computer classes in high school for three years and it has always been an interest for me. I have always wanted to learn coding and now felt the right time to learn!
